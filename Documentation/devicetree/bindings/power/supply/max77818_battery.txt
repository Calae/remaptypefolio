max77818_battery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties :
 - compatible : "maxim,max77818"

Optional properties :
 - maxim,rsns-microohm : Resistance of rsns resistor in micro Ohms
                         (datasheet-recommended value is 10000).
   Defining this property enables current-sense functionality.

Optional threshold properties :
 If skipped the condition won't be reported.
 - maxim,cold-temp :      Temperature threshold to report battery
                          as cold (in tenths of degree Celsius).
 - maxim,over-heat-temp : Temperature threshold to report battery
                          as over heated (in tenths of degree Celsius).
 - maxim,dead-volt :      Voltage threshold to report battery
                          as dead (in mV).
 - maxim,over-volt :      Voltage threshold to report battery
                          as over voltage (in mV).
 - maxim,min-soc-alert :  Threshold to report SOC as low (in %).
                          SOC at this level will cause the min SOC
                          alert to be disabled and the max SOC alert
                          to be enabled.
 - maxim,max-soc-alert :  Threshold to report SOC as high (in %).
                          SOC at this level will cause the max SOC
                          alert to be disabled and the min SOC alert
                          to be enabled

Example:

	battery-charger@36 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77818";
		reg = <0x36>;
		maxim,rsns-microohm = <10000>;
		maxim,over-heat-temp = <600>;
		maxim,over-volt = <4300>;
		maxim,min-soc-alert = <10>;
		maxim,max-soc-alert = <12>;
	};
